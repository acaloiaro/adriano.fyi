title: di-tui terminal UI player for di.fm
---

Hey all, just a quick post about [di-tui](https://github.com/acaloiaro/di-tui), my new [di.fm](di.fm) terminal UI player. I've been playing hours of music with this player over the past two weeks and have to say that I really love it and am proud of its ease of use and simplicity.

Most people who know me know that I work almost exclusively in the terminal: tmux, mutt, [slack-term](https://github.com/acaloiaro/slack-term), vim, and now `di-tui` and many more. Now I finally have great music in the terminal!

I hope someone else finds it useful.

Cheers
