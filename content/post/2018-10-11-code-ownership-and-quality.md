title: Code Ownership and Quality
---
Developers own everything they build. Not in the sense of intellectual property, but in the sense that the code we write, in some way, is forever our responsibility. So when I talk about code ownership, I'm mostly concerned with the *responsibility* born by the developer(s) who wrote it, and how responsibility-cum-ownership can be leveraged to alleviate some development pain points.

Ownership begins at problem ideation and lasts as long as a person remains part of a company or project (and often beyond). For the purpose of this post, I'm concerned with the phase of ownership between ideation and immediate post-release. This phase is important because it is generally where things go wrong and where development life-cycle pain points are most acutely felt. It's also the phase at which many developers relinquish a piece of their ownership to some other person, and that can be a painful process.

While developers retain some ownership of the things they build in perpetuity, they often own less of a particular thing over time.
