If you haven't guessed by now, my name is Adriano and I live in New York City. Despite living in the city, you're
more likely to find me climbing a mountain than fighting city crowds. I'm a Software Engineer by trade, but I hope
that that is the least interesting thing about me.

## What I do
I love technology, running, mountain and road biking, and most importantly â€” the great outdoors.
